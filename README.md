Python Media player

  -This is a Python media player built using PyQt5 library. It allows you to play both audio and video files with an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

Features

  -Play audio and video files
  -Control playback with play, pause, stop, fullscreen, miniplayer, playback speed buttons
  -Choose a file to play using the file dialog

Installation

  -Clone or download the repository
  -Install PyQt5 library: pip install PyQt5

Future improvement
  
  -Add more function to pymedia player: change quality of video, volume...
  
  -Možnost propojení s internetem například přehrávání automaticky stahovaných videi z youtube.
  
  -Playlist support: Allow the user to create and save playlists of their favorite songs. This would involve adding a playlist window to application where the user can    drag and drop songs to create a playlist. I also add support for adding and removing songs from a playlist and saving the playlist to a file for future use.

  -Equalizer: Add an equalizer to media player to allow the user to adjust the sound levels to their liking. This would involve adding a new window to application with    sliders for bass, treble, and other sound levels. 

  -Visualizations: Add visualizations to media player to make it more visually appealing. It could include a spectrum analyzer or waveform display that reacts to          the music being played. Users could also add a video player to support music videos or other visual content.

  -Media library: Allow the user to browse their local media library and play songs directly from your application. This would involve adding a media library window to    application that displays all the songs and albums available on the user's device. I also want to add support for searching and filtering the media library.

  -Remote control: Add support for remote control of media player using a mobile device or other remote control device. This would involve adding support for a            remote control protocol such as UPnP or DLNA. I maybe also develop a mobile app that connects to media player over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and allows the user to            control playback and adjust settings from their phone.
